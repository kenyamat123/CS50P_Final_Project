# Description:

My CS50P final project is a simple to do list where you can add, complete, delete, and view different tasks. I also have an exit choice where the user can exit the program. I included a project file, a test file to test my functions, the requirements file to include the pip library I installed, and this README file that explains what this program is. I only needed one library which was the pytest.

I did not collaborate with others as this was a program that I did myself. The way I decided to do this project was I viewed many other final projects, and this was the program that applies to me in my daily life. For example, I have a daily written to do list I use that is on a calendar. There were other programs that I viewed such as Instagram and other videos that did not apply to my life thus, I did not consider those. Being that this program applied to my life made it much easier.

How I did this project was to go back and look at the notes, shorts, and videos of the lectures in this CS50P class. I did not add any new skills to do this project as the material in the class was sufficient to do this project. That is another reason why I did not want to do a complex project as this simpler project was what worked best for me as well as for the sake of finishing the project and the class.

I started this program in Visual Studio Code and after I finished my coding for this to do list, it was not working because I did not have Python installed thus I installed it and then I installed the Python Extension Pack in Visual Studio Code. When I finished both the code for the program as well as for the tests, I then transferred it to CS50.dev. I will do the same with this README file.

In addition to my main function, I included a function for each choice. For example, the choice of “Add a task” has the function add_task, the choice of “Complete a task” has the function complete_task, the “Delete a task” choice has the function delete_task, and the “View task” choice has the function get_tasks.

My pytest file is in a file called test_project.py and has 8 tests and I installed the pytest library for this to work as stated above.

I did not use any other programming languages other than Python as my main goal for this project was to finish the course. I also did not add things like dates or anything else but to check mark and delete them as the tasks are completed or add new tasks as they come up.

Before I did my pytest file I tested the project by using it to make sure it works as planned. I did not want to program the pytest if I did not think my program worked as intended. When I realized it worked as intended, I think programmed my test file.

This is my CS50P final project.
